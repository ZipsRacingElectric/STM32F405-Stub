# Introdution to the CAN-Bus Communication Protocol - Zips Racing
CAN-Bus (or more specifically, CAN 2.0a) is a communication protocol used for connecting multiple control units spread over a large area. Due to its flexibility and reliability, CAN-Bus is a common choice for connecting the various subsystems of a vehicle.

## ChibiOS Interface
In ChibiOS, I2C is exposed through the CAN driver. The comprehensive driver documentation can be found at the below URL, however it is quite technical.

[common/doc/chibios/ChibiOS HAL Reference Manual.pdf](common/doc/chibios/ChibiOS&#32;HAL&#32;Reference&#32;Manual.pdf), page 83.

An excerpt of the most useful functionality is provided here.

### Transmit Frame
A message (also called a frame) that the user intents to transmit is represented by the `CANTxFrame` struct.
```
struct CANTxFrame
{
	// The data length code of the message (number of used bytes in the
	// payload).
	uint8_t DLC:4;

	// The RTR (remote transmit request) bit of the frame.
	uint8_t RTR:1;

	// The IDE (extended identifier) bit of the frame. If set to CAN_IDE_STD,
	// the SID is used, if set to CAN_IDE_EXT, the EID is used. (See below for
	// what these mean).
	uint8_t IDE:1;

	union
	{
		// The 11-bit standard identifier of the message (only used if
		// IDE = CAN_IDE_STD).
		uint32_t SID:11;

		// The 29-bit extended identifier of the message (only used if
		// IDE = CAN_IDE_EXT).
		uint32_t EID:29;
	};

	// This union is for accessing the payload of the frame, all of the fields point to the same data. The reason different
	// datatypes may be used is for convenience.
	union
	{
		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 8 8-bit integers.
		uint8_t data8[8];

		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 4 16-bit integers.
		uint16_t data16[4];

		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 2 32-bit integers.
		uint32_t data32[2];

		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 1 64-bit integer.
		uint64_t data64[1];
	};
}
```

### Transmitting Messages
In order to broadcast (also called transmit) a message, the `canTransmitTimeout` function should be used. The message to be transmitted is a user-created instance of the `CANTxFrame` struct.
```
msg_t canTransmitTimeout(CANDriver* canp, canmbx_t mailbox, const CANTxFrame* ctfp, sysinterval_t timeout)
```
Parameters:
- `canp`	- A pointer to the `CANDriver` object.
- `mailbox`	- The number of the mailbox(s) to use. Use `CAN_ANY_MAILBOX` for the first available mailbox.
- `ctfp`	- A pointer to the `CANTxFrame` to be transmitted.
- `timeout`	- The number of ticks before the operation times out. The following special values are allowed:
	- `TIME_IMMEDIATE` - Timeout immediately.
	- `TIME_INFINITE` - No timeout.

Return Value:
- `MSG_OK`		- The frame was transmitted successfully.
- `MSG_TIMEOUT`	- The operation has timed out.
- `MSG_RESET`	- The driver has been stopped while waiting.

### Receive Frame
A message (also called a frame) that is received by a device is represented by the `CANRxFrame` struct.
```
struct CANRxFrame
{
	// The data length code of the received message (number of bytes written
	// into the payload).
	uint8_t DLC:4;

	// The RTR (remote transmit request) bit of the frame.
	uint8_t RTR:1;

	// The IDE (extended identifier) bit of the frame. If set to CAN_IDE_STD,
	// the SID is used, if set to CAN_IDE_EXT, the EID is used. (See below for
	// what these mean).
	uint8_t IDE:1;

	union
	{
		// The 11-bit standard identifier of the message (only used if
		// IDE = CAN_IDE_STD).
		uint32_t SID:11;

		// The 29-bit extended identifier of the message (only used if
		// IDE = CAN_IDE_EXT).
		uint32_t EID:29;
	};

	// This union is for accessing the payload of the frame, all of the fields point to the same data. The reason different
	// datatypes may be used is for convenience.
	union
	{
		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 8 8-bit integers.
		uint8_t data8[8];

		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 4 16-bit integers.
		uint16_t data16[4];

		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 2 32-bit integers.
		uint32_t data32[2];

		// The payload of the message, accessed as an array of 1 64-bit integer.
		uint64_t data64[1];
	};
};
```

### Receiving Messages
In order to receive a message, the `canReceiveTimeout` function should be used. This function doesn't allow the user to specify *what* message is received, it will simply select the first message received, regardless of its identifier. To check what message was received, the contents of the `CANRxFrame` can be checked.
```
msg_t canReceiveTimeout(CANDriver* canp, canmbx_t mailbox, CANRxFrame* crfp, sysinterval_t timeout)
```
Parameters:
- `canp`	- A pointer to the `CANDriver` object.
- `mailbox`	- The number of the mailbox(s) to use. Use `CAN_ANY_MAILBOX` for the first available mailbox.
- `crfp`	- A pointer to the buffer where the `CANRxFrame` is to be copied.
- `timeout`	- The number of ticks before the operation times out. The following special values are allowed:
	- `TIME_IMMEDIATE`	- Timeout immediately, this is useful in an event driven scenario where a thread never blocks for I/O.
    - `TIME_INFINITE`	- No timeout.

Return Value:
- `MSG_OK`		- A frame has been received and placed in the buffer.
- `MSG_TIMEOUT`	- The operation has timed out.
- `MSG_RESET`	- The driver has been stopped while waiting.
