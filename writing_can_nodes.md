# Writing CAN Nodes - Zips Racing
The STM32F405 common library further abstracts ChibiOS's CAN interface further with the CAN node interface. The main purpose of a CAN node is to decode the CAN messages of a specific devices a the CAN-bus (sensors and control units, for example). The CAN node loosely uses an inheritance pattern, meaning there is an interface (the `canNode_t` struct) and then there are implementors of said interface (ex. `bms_t` or `amk_t`). The interface is never meant to be directly instanced, rather it simply describes how specific CAN nodes should *look*.

## Defining a Structure
In order to make different implementations of the CAN node appear the same, they must begin with the same fields. This can be done using the `CAN_NODE_FIELDS` macro. For example, consider the below implementation:
```
typedef struct
{
	// The structure must start with these fields.
	CAN_NODE_FIELDS;

	// Now we can add whatever we want here...
	uint8_t testField0;
	uint8_t testField1;
} testNode_t;
```

By defining the structure this way, it is interchangeable with the `canNode_t` base structure.
```
// Here we have some instance of the structure we defined.
testNode_t nodeInstance = ...;

// To use it with a function expecting a base CAN node, we can use a cast.
canNodeResetTimeout ((canNode_t*) &nodeInstance);
```

## Initialization
Before it can be used, a CAN node must first be initialized and configured. To do this the `canNodeConfig_t` structure and `canNodeInit` function are provided.

The configuration structure allows the implementor to modify the behavior of the node. Note the `receiveHandler` function, which will be described later in the 'Receive Handler' section of this document.
```
struct canNodeConfig_t
{
	// The CAN driver of the bus the node belongs to. Used for sending messages to the node.
	CANDriver* driver;

	// Function for handling received messages that may or may not belong to the node.
	canReceiveHandler_t* receiveHandler;

	// Optional function to invoke when the node's data times out, use NULL to not handle timeout events.
	canEventHandler_t* timeoutHandler;

	// The interval to timeout the node's data after.
	sysinterval_t timeoutPeriod;

	// The total number of messages belonging to the node. Used to determine if the dataset is complete or not.
	uint8_t messageCount;
};
```

Inside of its implementation of an initialization function, a CAN node should call the `canNodeInit` function to initialize the fields of the `canNode_t` portion of structure.
```
void canNodeInit (canNode_t* node, const canNodeConfig_t* config);
```
Parameters:
- `node` - A pointer to the node to initialize.
- `config` - A pointer to the configuration to use.

## Implementing a Receive Handler
Each CAN node implementation should have a unique `canReceiveHandler_t` function. This purpose of this function is to determine whether the received message belongs to a node (by checking the frame's SID/EID). If the message does belong to the node, the message should be decoded to update the internal field(s) of the structure.
```
typedef int8_t (canReceiveHandler_t) (void* node, CANRxFrame* frame);
```
Parameters:
- `node`	- A pointer to the CAN node (the node that should be checked for / updated).
- `frame`	- The CAN frame that was received.

Return Value:
- A unique index for what message was received, between 0 (inclusive) and `messageCount` (exclusive).
- -1 to indicate the message does not belong to this node.
